# The EU4 Macros
A few macros for Europa Universalis IV

## Burgundy Macro
- The "Burgundy" macro is used for a strategy with the Burgundian Inheritance which requires giving every province but your capital to Burgundy. Instead of clicking for 15 minutes you can use it.
- To use it, simply open the file and press F3 after you have gone to your vassals menu and clicked on Burgundy, as shown.
