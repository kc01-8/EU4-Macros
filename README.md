# EU4-Macros
A few macros for Europa Universalis IV

The "Burgundy" macro is used for a strategy with the burgundian inheritance which requires giving every province but your capital to burgundy. Instead of clicking for 15 minutes you can use it.

The "State_Unstate" macro will either unstate or restate all of your states for you automatically.

Please note you will have to do the last page manually in most cases.
