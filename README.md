# The EU4 Macros
A few macros for Europa Universalis IV

## Burgundy Macro
- The "Burgundy" macro is used for a strategy with the Burgundian Inheritance which requires giving every province but your capital to Burgundy. Instead of clicking for 15 minutes you can use it.
- To use it, simply open the file and press F3 after you have gone to your vassals menu and clicked on Burgundy, as shown.


## State Unstate
- The "State Unstate" macro will either unstate or restate all of your states for you automatically.
- To use it, open the file and press F2 after you have opened the states menu in the outliner.

#### Important
Please note you will have to do the last page manually in most cases.
You need the program [Auto Hot Key](https://github.com/AutoHotkey/AutoHotkey/releases) to open the macros.
